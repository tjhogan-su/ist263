        <h1>About Me - Tanner Hogan</h1>
        <p>My name is <strong>Tanner Hogan</strong> and I am a junior <strong><em><u>graphic design</u></em></strong> major from New Jersey. Growing up, I was always fascinated by all types of art and design. I currently work as a digital design director for Jerk Magazine, a student publication here at Syracuse. Along with that, I began working as a graphic design intern for Syracuse Athletics this past June and plan to continue into the fall.</p>
        <p>This past summer I declared myself as an <em><abbr title="Information Management & Technology">IMT</abbr></em> minor. IST 263 is one of two iSchool classes that I am taking this semester. These two classes are my first steps towards my minor, however, I took a few classes relating to computer science and web development in high school. I am excited to learn more about these topics and am looking forward to a great semester!</p>
